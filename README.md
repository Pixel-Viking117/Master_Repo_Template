# \# Unity Project Template (Public Version)

# 

# This repository serves as a \*\*standard public template\*\* for creating new Unity projects. It is designed for general use, collaboration, open-source work, tutorials, game jams, and shared development environments.

# 

# It includes recommended structure, safety rules, and version control practices used across the industry.

# 

# ---

# 

# \## 🎯 Purpose

# 

# \* Provide a clean, ready-to-use Unity project foundation.

# \* Ensure all Unity auto-generated files are ignored from version control.

# \* Protect all environment/secret files using standard ignore patterns.

# \* Offer a consistent project layout for anyone cloning or forking the template.

# \* Make it easy to start new Unity projects with no setup required.

# 

# \## 📁 Repository Structure

# 

# A typical new Unity project looks like this:

# 

# ```

# UnityTemplate/

# &nbsp;   Assets/

# &nbsp;   Packages/

# &nbsp;   ProjectSettings/

# &nbsp;   README.md

# &nbsp;   .gitignore

# ```

# 

# You may add your own folders as needed:

# 

# ```

# Assets/

# &nbsp;   Art/

# &nbsp;   Scripts/

# &nbsp;   Scenes/

# &nbsp;   Audio/

# ```

#

# 

# \## 🧰 Version Control Safety (Git Ignore)

# 

# This template includes a \*\*Unity-standard `.gitignore`\*\*, designed to keep your repository clean and safe.

# 

# \### ✔ Unity Auto-Generated Files (Ignored)

# 

# ```

# Library/

# Temp/

# Obj/

# Build/

# Builds/

# Logs/

# UserSettings/

# MemoryCaptures/

# \*.csproj

# \*.sln

# \*.vsconfig

# ```

# 

# These files are regenerated by Unity and must \*\*never\*\* be committed.

# 

# \### ✔ Environment \& Secret Files (Ignored)

# 

# All `.env` and variant files are ignored using industry-standard patterns:

# 

# ```

# \*\*/\*.env

# \*\*/\*.env.\*

# ```

# 

# This ensures you never accidentally upload API keys, tokens, or personal configuration.
